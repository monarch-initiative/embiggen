    "## Creating the training and validation partitions\n",
    "To execute the embedding of the graph ~~for the porpose~~ with the goal of running Link Prediction on the obtained vectors (after having obtained the edges embeddings from the nodes embeddings), we need to create two partitions of the graph. One containing the training set edges, which is left connected (if the initial graph was connected) or at least with the same number of connected components are the initial graph, and one containing the validation set edges, which may not be connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirement for connectivity is stated in the seminal work from [Leskovec et al.](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/pubs/node2vec-kdd16.pdf) but we have no proofs, currently, that actually changes performance of the embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation in using connected training set\n",
    "Creating holdouts in this fashion allows us to estimate the real-world model performance only for cases when the new edges that we intend to predict are part of the existing graph components and do not ever connect separated components of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why not simply using the complete graph in the embedding process\n",
    "If we were to use the complete graph during the embedding process, we would end up encoding the answers for the Link Prediction problem into the embedding for both the training and validation partitions, hence adding a positive bias that would inflate the performance of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB: the entire graph should be used for embeddings when the task will be a node-label prediction task, when no nodes labels are taken in consideration in any shape of form during the random walks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The inevitable presence of false negatives in the embedding training process\n",
    "\n",
    "In the training set of the model there will be inevitably some false negatives. These originates from the sampling of random edges as negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Binary SkipGram, meaning the models that receive two words and tries to predict if the connection exists or not, this sampling is needed to produce negative examples so that the network don't overfit returning always true.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Categorical-Models, such as CBOW and non-binary SkipGram, meaning the one which either receive the context and tries to predict the central word, or receives the word and tries to predict the context, the sample is only present if they use the [Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE)](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/nce_loss) loss which, instead of computing the softmax and the categorical cross entropy, samples a random number of categories per batch and applies, to the choosen outputs, a sigmoid activation function, hence computing the logits, and then computes the binary cross-entropy for each of them. Finally the losses are summed to obtain the final loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the problem of false negatives araise from the fact that during the computation of the NCE loss, in order to have negative examples, the function samples random words to use as wrong predictions for the given context. This of course could create false negatives if the choosen random word appears in another batch with the same context, and can be easily shown that this leads to sampling potentialy false negative edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only method to avoid these is to do the **embedding on the whole graph** which create a positive bias for the link-prediction.\n",
    "This bias is formed because the embedding is encoding the data by learning which nodes are close and **thus is encoding the link prediction of the validation set and invalidating the link-prediction performances**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the only way is to accept the false negatives since in a real world application the link prediction is used as an oracle to explore new possible edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional false positives relative to collisions with known training edges\n",
    "For the same sampling issue, there will be also collisions with the training edges. This should be a lesser problem though, as the model will be more likely to see the positive label for any given training edge that the collision, though to the strong imbalance between the number of available training edges and the complete number of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "This imbalance, in PPI, is around 1 positive edge to 1000 negative edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Early stopping criterion for the embedding process\n",
    "For the early stopping criterion used in the embedding process, during the model selection (the procedure where we select the optimal $p$, $q$ and embedding size parameters, amongs others) we can use the validation partition to stop the training early (hence early stopping) when a metric representing of the quality of the embedding stops improving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the validation set is not connected we cannot diretly use the validation set for th early stopping, as it would not allow us to create random walks that represent the graph structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason we need to use the entire training+validation set for the early stopping. This will allow us to compute random walks that should be representative of the graph structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation edges are never fed into the training model as positives, but are only used in the context of the early stopping."
